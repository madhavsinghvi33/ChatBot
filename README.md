# ChatBot
## A ChatBot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.
## There are two different kinds of ChatBots:
## 1. Task Oriented ChatBots
## 2. Data Driven and Predictive ChatBots.

## This code is an example of a simple data driven and predictive ChatBot. Through the use of this, you can have a simple conversation with your computer. A picture has been uploaded under this repository showing how the ChatBot looks and works. (File Name: ChatBot.png)

## As I started coding more in python, I wanted to try something slightly more ambitious. Since I also wanted to do something related to prediction algorithm and data analytics, making a ChatBot was the perfect medium to accomplish both my goals.
